# Website SponsorQu
This repository represents my team's project developed using the Laravel framework and utilizing some of Firebase features such as the Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Authentication. The website aims to facilitate connections between organizations, small and medium enterprises, and companies for potential partnerships.

## Description Product
SponsorQu is a website that connects F&B Company, MSME, and Student Organizations. Through SponsorQu website, they can establish partnership by simply submitting a proposal or store/product portfolio. 
SponsorQu makes it easy for MSMEs and student organizations to contact F&B companies for sponsorship purposes. In addition, we also provide a place for the three roles to interact through posts. SponsorQu can cut down the time of student organizations in finding funds and can be a way for MSME owners to find new customers and expand their market.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.
